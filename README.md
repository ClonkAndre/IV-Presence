# IV-Presence
This mod allows you to share your actions from GTA IV to everyone via Discord's Rich Presence feature.

⚠ WARNING: Mod might crash depending on iv/eflc radio and whether you have combined radios. I'm trying to fix that in the next version. ⚠  

## Requirements
- GTA IV 1070 or 1080  
- ASI Loader
